## TODO

- [x] HashiCorp Vault for secrets management
- [x] Make all environment variables forcefully required (so that Docker fails if they are empty)
- [x] Ansible playbook instead of `update.sh`
- [x] Migrate firewall config as well
- [x] Automate using Github Actions, ArgoCD, or n8n

For any questions or issues, feel free to open an issue in this repository.
