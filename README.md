## TODO

- [ ] HashiCorp Vault for secrets management
- [ ] Make all environment variables forcefully required (so that Docker fails if they are empty)
- [ ] Ansible playbook instead of `update.sh`
- [ ] Migrate firewall config as well
- [ ] Automate using Github Actions, ArgoCD, or n8n

For any questions or issues, feel free to open an issue in this repository.
